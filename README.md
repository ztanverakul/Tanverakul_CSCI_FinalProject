# Tanverakul_CSCI_FinalProject
My final project will be a program that takes all the starting nfl quarterbacks and lists them by quarterback rating, number of touchdown passes and number of interceptions.
I will use a linked list data structure to organize all my data.
It will then create three different classes of qb: dumpster-fire, mediocre, and elite. 
Im going to use a graph to make connections between them based off of those three criteria listed above.
Then the program will then post a random profile of a quarterback and the user has to guess.
The user will only get 3 guesses, and will get a rating of elite, mediocre, or dumpste-fire depending on whether they get it on the first, second or third guess respectively.
